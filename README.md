## Tania Rascia ðŸ’¾

Hi, I'm Taniaâ€”a software engineer, open source creator, technical writer, and former chef. I'm always writing and documenting what I learn at [taniarascia.com](https://www.taniarascia.com/) (or [tania.dev](https://tania.dev) for short). I keep all my open source projects and tutorial demos here.

### Favorites

I create concise walkthroughs for beginners and intermediate developers. Here are a few of the most popular ones:

### Philosophy

My [website philosophy](https://www.taniarascia.com/philosophy/) is to have no ads, no social media, no tracking or analytics, no sponsored posts or affiliates, and no paywall. I want to reduce the noise and desperation on the internet and provide something of value for free.

### What else?

I like strategy games, bike rides, accordions, the '80s, coffee, The Expanse book series, listening to and playing music, writing about what I learn, and coding.
